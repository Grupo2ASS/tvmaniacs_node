TVManiacs Crawler/Scraper
=========================

This repo has 2 Node.js projects, developed by Group 2 of *Arquitectura de Sistemas de Software* 2013-2, from Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile (PUC).
Both are independent modules with specific functions.

Crawler
-------
Uses sylvinus' node-crawler(https://github.com/sylvinus/node-crawler).

*	Gets urls for http://www.metacritic.com/ and http://www.imdb.com/tv/ from local database (with scheduled revisiting) or randomly generates them.
*	Gets html files and cleans them (to save memory space).
* Stores clean HTML files on HDD.

Scraper
-------
Uses cheerio (https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio)

*	Reads .html files from HDD
*	Stores links to other pages to be visited by the crawler on a local DB.
*	Gets information about actors and tv series and stores them on dedicated MongoDB server.

How to use
--------
There are 3 folders: crawler, scraper and config.
First go to config and run "npm install" and then "node init_workspace.js". This will create the .db with "Game of Thrones"
link and the html_folder with the subdirectories of imdb and metacritics.
Then go to scraper and run "npm install" and then "node scraper.js" (Important: the terminal will be attached to this program).
Finally, go to crawler and run "npm install" and then "node crawler.js" (Important: the terminal will be attached to this program).
When both crawler and scraper are running at the same time, they work together as it was explained before.


Tests
--------
To execute or create tests jasmine-node must be installed, go to tests folder and run "npm install jasmine-node -g". In this folder run "jasmine-node spec" to execute all tests inside spec. To add a test just name the file "name-spec.js" and move it into spec folder.
